Marine Biology & Ocean Science
Octopus Anatomy: Octopuses have three hearts: two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it through the rest of the body.
Fish Filters: A fish-inspired filter developed in December 2025 can remove over 99% of microplastics from washing machine discharge.
Sea Urchin Pandemic: A mass die-off is currently decimating sea urchin populations globally in 2025, particularly around the Canary Islands.
Whale Biology: The blue whale's tongue weighs as much as a full-grown elephant, and its aorta is large enough for a human child to crawl through.
Dolphin Sleep: Dolphins are "sleepwalkers"—they sleep with only half of their brain at a time and keep one eye open to watch for predators.
Coral Significance: Although coral reefs cover less than 2% of the ocean floor, they support roughly 25% of all marine species.
Bioluminescence in Fossils: Researchers in 2025 used UV light to reveal hidden polka-dot patterns on 5-million-year-old seashells.
Deep-Sea Discovery: A study found nearly 900 new species in an area of the deep ocean only half the size of a tennis court.
Sargassum Blooms: In late 2025, massive seaweed blooms in the Atlantic were found to be fueled by complex nitrogen partnerships between algae and bacteria.
Communication: Larval coral trout can navigate back to their home reefs by using their sense of smell and the sound of the ocean.
