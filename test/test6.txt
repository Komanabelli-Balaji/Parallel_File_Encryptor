Earth & Environment (2025)
Rotation Slowing: Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing; every century, the length of a day increases by about 1.8 seconds.
Magnetic Flip: Earth’s magnetic poles have reversed 171 times in the last 71 million years, and the North Pole is currently moving at 55 km per year.
Happiest Country: Finland was ranked as the happiest country on Earth for the sixth consecutive year in 2024–2025.
Dust Composition: Most of the dust found in residential homes consists largely of dead human skin cells.
Atmospheric Heat: Lightning is five times hotter than the surface of the Sun, reaching temperatures of 30,000°C.
Cloud Weight: A typical fluffy cloud can weigh over one million tonnes due to the massive volume of water droplets it contains.
Sea Level Inequality: "Sea level" is not actually level; it bulges at the equator due to the Earth's spin and varies based on local gravity.
Fungal Networks: Trees use underground "Wood Wide Webs" of fungi to share nutrients and send distress signals to other trees.
Antarctica Dryness: Antarctica is technically a desert and is considered the driest continent on Earth.
Ice Density: Seawater becomes denser as it gets colder until it reaches its freezing point, unlike fresh water which is most dense at 4°C.
