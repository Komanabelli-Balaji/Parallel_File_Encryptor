Space Exploration in 2025
Exoplanet Milestone: As of late 2025, the number of confirmed worlds discovered beyond our solar system has surpassed 6,000.
Private Moon Landing: In March 2025, Firefly Aerospace’s "Blue Ghost" successfully landed in the Sea of Crises, becoming the second private spacecraft ever to soft-land on the Moon.
The "Great Comet": Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) became visible to the naked eye early in 2025, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.
Mars Occultation: On January 13, 2025, skywatchers in North America witnessed the "Wolf Moon" occult (hide) Mars, an event occurring once every 14 years from a specific location.
Total Lunar Eclipse: A "Blood Worm Moon" occurred on March 13–14, 2025, with the Moon appearing reddish-orange for 65 minutes as it passed through Earth’s shadow.
Interstellar Visitor: In 2025, astronomers confirmed 3I/ATLAS as the third-ever interstellar object found in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov.
Solar Maximum Peaks: Frequent "G4" geomagnetic storms in 2025 caused spectacular auroras visible as far south as mid-latitude regions.
Radar Satellite Launch: The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) launched on July 30, 2025, to provide high-resolution imagery for remote sensing.
Proxima Centauri Findings: Scientists using the NIRPS spectrograph in 2025 confirmed the presence of the Earth-sized planet Proxima b in the sun's closest neighboring system.
Planetary Disintegration: Researchers in 2025 observed a planet shedding a comet-like tail of debris 5.6 million miles long as it orbits a nearby white dwarf.
