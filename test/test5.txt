Animal Kingdom Oddities
Koala Fingerprints: Koalas are among the few animals that possess true fingerprints nearly identical to those of humans.
Sloth Survival: Sloths can hold their breath underwater for up to 40 minutes, which is longer than some dolphin species.
Ant Breathing: Ants do not have lungs; they breathe through tiny openings called spiracles along their sides.
Shrimp Heart: A shrimp’s heart is located in its head rather than its chest.
Flamingo Diet: Flamingos are born with gray or white feathers and only turn pink after eating a diet rich in brine shrimp and algae.
Polar Bear Skin: Underneath their thick white fur, polar bears actually have jet-black skin to help absorb heat from the sun.
Snail Teeth: Some snails have between 1,000 and 12,000 microscopic teeth located on their tongues.
Puffer Fish Myth: Puffer fish do not hold their breath to inflate; they gulp huge amounts of water into their stomachs while continuing to breathe through their gills.
Penguin Diving: Emperor penguins can dive to depths of over 550 meters (1,800 feet) in a single plunge.
Bat Vision: Despite the phrase "blind as a bat," bats are not blind; they simply use echolocation to navigate better in total darkness.
