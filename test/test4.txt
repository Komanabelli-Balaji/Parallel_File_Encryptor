Human Body & Senses
Brain Power: The human brain burns approximately 400–500 calories a day, about 20% of the body's total energy requirement.
Stomach Renewal: Your stomach lining completely renews itself every 3 to 4 days to prevent it from digesting itself.
Bone Strength: Human bones are roughly five times stronger than steel of the same weight.
Fingerprints: Identical twins do not have identical fingerprints due to different environmental factors in the womb during development.
Iron Content: The average human body contains enough iron to manufacture one small metal nail.
Scent Recognition: The human nose is capable of recognizing and remembering over one trillion different scents.
Phagocytosis: Your brain cells are constantly "eating" themselves through a healthy process called phagocytosis to remove old molecules.
Self-Healing: Human teeth are the only part of the body that cannot heal themselves because they are not made of living tissue.
Anxiety Sweat: One theory suggests humans evolved to sweat when anxious as a way to chemically alert others to potential danger.
Voice Perception: You dislike the sound of your own voice because your skull bones make it sound deeper and richer to you than it does to others.
